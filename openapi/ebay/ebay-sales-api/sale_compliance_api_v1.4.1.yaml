            non-compliant against an eBay listing policy. Generally, OUT_OF_COMPLIANCE
            policy violations can prevent the seller from revising a listing until
            the underlying violation(s) can be remedied. When the compliance state
            is AT_RISK, the seller is not blocked from revising the listing, but the
            seller should correct the violation to prevent the listing from being
            blocked for revisions in the future. Note: This field is returned for
            most violations, but not all. In the case that this field is not returned,
